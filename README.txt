1). We, (Isaiah, Tim, and Tom) managed to complete all the steps and did exactly what they told us to do
2). To verify that everything works, run the simulator with this code here and Enter any string. Backspace works properly, and doesn't go backwards past the screen, although you can erase the "Enter a Line" string if you want to. 
Upon hitting "enter", the message.txt will print out with our entered string, and then you can enter one more line, and hitting enter will stop the program. You can also add more interupt21 calls in the code in order to write more lines!
